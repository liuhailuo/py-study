The connecting wires at the place of installation must not be live when removing the 
meter. Touching live parts is dangerous to life. The corresponding main fuses should be 
removed and kept in a safe place until work is completed, so that they cannot be replaced 
by anyone unnoticed.
Remove the meter from the network as follows:
1 Turn off the load by using the meter breaker
2 Switch off the voltage and remove the fuses. The display goes off.
3 Open the sealing screw covers and remove the seals.
4 Release and remove the terminal cover.
